# 📘 Assignment: Python Data Visualization

## 🎯 Objective

Learn to create professional charts and graphs using matplotlib and plotly to visualize data effectively. You'll practice transforming raw data into meaningful visualizations that tell a story and communicate insights clearly.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Create Line Charts with Matplotlib

#### Description
Create a line chart to visualize trends over time. You'll load a dataset, prepare the data, and use matplotlib to generate a professional line chart with proper labels, title, and formatting.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Load data from a CSV file or use a sample dataset
- Create a line chart showing trends over time
- Include a title, axis labels, and a legend
- Customize the appearance (colors, line styles, markers)
- Save the chart as an image file

### 🛠️ Build Multiple Chart Types with Plotly

#### Description
Create multiple interactive visualizations using plotly to display different aspects of a dataset. You'll create bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts to explore different dimensions of your data.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create at least 3 different chart types (bar, scatter, pie)
- Use plotly's interactive features (hover information, zoom, pan)
- Customize colors and styling for each chart
- Display charts with clear titles and axis labels
- Combine multiple charts into a dashboard view

### 🛠️ Analyze and Visualize Your Own Dataset

#### Description
Find or create your own dataset and develop a series of visualizations to analyze and present the data. Practice choosing appropriate chart types for different questions and insights.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Use a dataset with at least 3 variables
- Create visualizations that answer specific questions about the data
- Use both matplotlib and plotly
- Include at least 5 different charts
- Add annotations or insights explaining what the visualizations reveal
